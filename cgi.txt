SERVER_SOFTWARE — name/version of HTTP server.

SERVER_NAME — host name of the server, may be dot-decimal IP address.

GATEWAY_INTERFACE — CGI/version.

** Request specific variables:

SERVER_PROTOCOL — HTTP/version.

SERVER_PORT — TCP port (decimal).

REQUEST_METHOD — name of HTTP method (see above).

PATH_INFO — path suffix, if appended to URL after program name and a slash.

PATH_TRANSLATED — corresponding full path as supposed by server, if PATH_INFO is present.

SCRIPT_NAME — relative path to the program, like /cgi-bin/script.cgi.

QUERY_STRING — the part of URL after ? character. May be composed
of *name=value pairs separated with ampersands (such as
var1=val1&var2=val2…) when used to submit form data transferred via

REMOTE_HOST — host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup.

REMOTE_ADDR — IP address of the client (dot-decimal).
